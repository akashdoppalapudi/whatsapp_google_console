# Whatsapp Google Integration Console App

A feature for WhatsApp to integrate with Google drive.
Users should be able to send files that are in drive right in whatsapp without needing to switch between apps.

## Details

I have used local json files to store data.
And used python files functionality with json module to read and write the json files.
